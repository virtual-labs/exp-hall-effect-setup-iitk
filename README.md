### About the Experiment 


This experiment is concern about the process from which we can determine the value of hall coefficient, carrier density and mobility of a semiconductor materials.<br><br>
 The Hall effect is a phenomenon in which a voltage is generated transverse to an electric current in a material when it is subjected to a magnetic field. The Hall effect is widely used to study the properties of materials, including semiconductors.<br><br>
To determine the Hall coefficient, carrier density, and mobility of a given semiconductor material, a Hall effect setup is used. The setup typically consists of a sample of the material, a source of electric current, a magnetic field source, and a voltage measurement device.<br><br>
First, a constant electric current is passed through the sample, and the magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the current. The transverse voltage generated as a result of the Hall effect is measured, and from this measurement, the Hall coefficient can be calculated.<br><br>
The carrier density can then be determined from the Hall coefficient and the mobility can be calculated from the ratio of the electrical conductivity to the carrier density. These parameters provide important information about the material's electronic properties and can be used to differentiate between different types of semiconductors, such as p-type and n-type.<br><br>
In summary, the Hall effect setup is used to study the electronic properties of a given semiconductor material by determining the Hall coefficient, carrier density, and mobility, which provide valuable information about the material's behavior and performance in various applications.<br><br>
