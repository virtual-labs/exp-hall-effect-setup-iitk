#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :  
1. Introduction: Introduce the students to the Hall effect and its applications. Explain the basic principle behind the Hall effect and how it is used to determine the properties of a given semiconductor material.<br>
2. Preparation: Set up the Hall effect experiment and make sure that the students understand the functioning of the apparatus. Familiarize the students with the procedure and the parameters that will be measured.<br>
3. Experiment: Demonstrate the experiment and guide the students through the process of determining the Hall coefficient, carrier density and mobility of the semiconductor material.<br>
4. Data Collection: Ask the students to measure the current, magnetic field and voltage across the sample. Encourage them to take multiple readings and record the data in a tabular form.<br>
5. Data Analysis: Explain the methods to calculate the Hall coefficient, carrier density and mobility of the semiconductor material. Guide the students to calculate these values using the data they have collected.<br>
6. Conclusion: Discuss the results of the experiment and compare them with the known values. Help the students understand the significance of the results and how they can be used to determine the quality of the material.<br>
7. Review: Encourage the students to review the steps of the experiment and the methods used to calculate the parameters. Ask them to reflect on their understanding of the Hall effect and its applications.<br>
 <u>   
Assessment Method:  <br> 
1. Preparation: Obtain the Hall effect setup, semiconductor material sample, and necessary electrical equipment such as power supply and multimeter.<br>
2. Sample preparation: Clean and prepare the semiconductor material sample for testing. Ensure that it is free of contaminants and has a uniform surface.<br>
3. Circuit setup: Connect the Hall effect setup to the power supply and multimeter. Ensure that the setup is calibrated and all connections are secure.<br>
4. Measurement: Apply a constant direct current (DC) to the semiconductor sample through the Hall effect setup. Measure the voltage difference across the sample, which is known as the Hall voltage.<br>
5. Data collection: Record the Hall voltage and magnetic field strength. Repeat the measurement several times to obtain an average Hall voltage value.<br>
6. Calculation: The Hall coefficient (R_H) can be determined using the equation: R_H = V_H / (B * I), where V_H is the Hall voltage, B is the magnetic field strength, and I is the current applied to the sample.<br>
7. Carrier density and mobility: The carrier density can be calculated using the equation: n = 1/eR_H, where e is the electron charge. The mobility of the carriers can be determined using the equation: μ = R_H * n / B.<br>
8. Interpretation: Compare the results obtained from the Hall effect setup with those obtained from other techniques, such as electrical conductivity or carrier lifetime measurements. This will provide a comprehensive understanding of the semiconductor material's properties.<br>
9. Report: Compile the results obtained from the Hall effect measurement, including the Hall coefficient, carrier density, and mobility, in a report. Present the results in a clear and concise manner, along with the conclusions and implications of the study.<br>
 <br>    
<u> <b>Description: </b>    </u>
<br>
The Hall effect is a phenomenon that occurs when a magnetic field is applied perpendicular to a current-carrying conductor. The Hall effect can be used to determine various properties of a material, such as its Hall coefficient, carrier density, and mobility.<br><br>
To study the Hall effect and determine these properties, a Hall effect setup is used. The setup typically consists of a sample of the material, a magnetic field generator, and a voltmeter. The sample is placed in a magnetic field and a current is applied through it. The voltage difference that is generated between the two sides of the sample due to the magnetic field is then measured using the voltmeter.<br><br>
The Hall coefficient is a constant that characterizes the material's response to the magnetic field. It can be determined from the relationship between the magnetic field strength and the Hall voltage. The carrier density is the number of charge carriers in the material, which can be calculated from the Hall coefficient and the magnetic field strength. The mobility is the speed at which charge carriers move through the material, and can be calculated from the carrier density and the current density.<br><br>
By conducting this experiment, the Hall effect and the various properties of the given semiconductor material can be studied and determined. This information can be useful in understanding the material's electrical and magnetic properties and its applications in electronics and other fields.<br>
